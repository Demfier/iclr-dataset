# Dataset Name (Acronym)
Here we present the *ICLR dataset* consisting of abstracts of all ICLR submissions from 2017--2024 with meta-data and custom keyword-based labels. We scraped the publicly available abstracts and metadata from OpenReview and created labels based on the keywords specified by the authors. We find that on this dataset, bag-of-words representation outperforms most dedicated sentence transformer models and the top performing language models barely outperform TF-IDF. We see this is a challenge for the NLP community. The benefits of the *ICLR dataset* suggested here are (i) its compact size; (ii) it not being part of the training set of existing sentence transformer models; (iii) covering topics very familiar to machine learning researchers, allowing qualitative assessment of embedding quality.

**Additional Notes:** 

**Labels**
To label the dataset, we relied on the author-provided keywords and used them to assign papers to 45 non-overlapping classes. We combined some keywords together into one class (e.g. *attention* and *transformer*), disregarded very broad keywords (e.g. *deep learning*), and assigned papers to rarer classes first. Using this procedure, we ended up labeling 53% of all papers (12997). In total, 11350 were left unlabeled because of either not containing keywords or only containing keywords that were not assigned to any class because of being too general or too specific.

**Scores**
Reviewed papers had on average 3.57 reviews, with 94\% having either 3 or 4 reviews. Across all 161\,204 possible pairs of reviews of the same paper, the correlation coefficient between scores was 0.42.

This process of active interaction is in the same spirit as a scientist performing experiments to discover hidden facts. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have yielded machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems; however, it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. In this work we introduce a basic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and cohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can manipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.  We also compare our learned experimentation policies to randomized baselines and show that the learned policies lead to better predictions.',

#### Motivating Factor(s)
<!-- scope: microscope -->

Goals:

- Use the dataset to explore the machine learning landscape and how research topics and other aspects (e.g. gender bias) have evolved across the years.
- Frame an NLP challenge: without using our labels, train a language model that would substantially surpass a naive TF-IDF representation in terms of $k$NN accuracy. We found that most dedicated sentence models fared *worse* than TF-IDF, and none outperformed it by over 1%.

We describe the challenge and the analyses in our paper: https://openreview.net/forum?id=XXXX
