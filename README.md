![ICLR dataset, SBERT embedding](/results/figures/final_figures/embedding.png)

The ICLR dataset is the complete scrape of ICLR submissions from OpenReview. It contains 24,445 ICLR submissions from 2017 to 2024: titles, authors, abstracts, keywords, decisions, and scores. 26 submissions with placeholder abstracts (below 100 characters) are excluded. We also provide non-overlapping labels based on merged keywords.

The dataset is described in Gonz치lez-M치rquez & Kobak, Gonz치lez M치rquez et al., Learning representations of learning representations, DMLR workshop at ICLR 2024. Please cite as follows:
